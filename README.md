*Description* : 
This project demonstrates how to build a basic rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users and respond to common queries related to Python programming.
 Overview
1. Importing NLTK and Chat Utilities
The script uses nltk.chat.util.Chat and reflections for creating a conversational interface.
reflections is a built-in dictionary that maps first-person pronouns to second-person and vice versa (e.g., “I” ↔ “you”).
2. Defining Chat Patterns (Pairs)
A list of pattern-response pairs is defined using regular expressions.
Each pattern is matched against user input, and a relevant response is selected.
3. Starting the Conversation
The chatbot prints a welcome message and waits for user input.
Users can type natural phrases (e.g., “How do I learn Python?”), and the bot replies accordingly.
Typing "quit" ends the session

*Output* :  
Welcome to the Python chatbot! Type 'quit' to exit.
